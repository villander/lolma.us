The flagship product of Hell'o Baby was originally implemented in Backbone, I led it's reimplementation from scratch in Angular. I did frontend developer myself and managed outstaffed devs.

I leveraged Ember to implement the company's internal admin panel. In its core was a builder of high-level database requests. A sophisticated form was generated dynamically according to a structure determined by the backend.

The resulting data selections were presented as various graphs built with [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/demo) for analytics.

The admin panel also offered an email builder — for both newsletters and individual messages. All email templates were rendered live into a thumbnail gallery. The gallery could be filtered.

Hell'o Baby homepage contains complex canvas animations, designed by company's artists. In order to keep performance stable, I had to orchestrate animations, so that only currently visible animations were playing. Animations that appeared nearby were synchronized.
