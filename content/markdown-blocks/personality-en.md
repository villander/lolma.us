title: Personality
---

At work I'm a passionate developer; strong supporter of best practices and patterns; serious about code readability, maintainability and scalability; believe in testing. On the scale from quick-n-dirty to slow-but-thorough, I lean toward the latter.

Off duty, I'm a loving husband and father, an avid debater, a board game geek, a retired recreational cyclist, a crazy Russian and an affable guy with a slightly twisted sense of humor.

I live in Moscow, Russia. Love working remotely from other beautiful places. Able to adjust to your timezone for partial or full work hours overlap.
